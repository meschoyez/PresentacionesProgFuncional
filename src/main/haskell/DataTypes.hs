--  Every card has a suit:
data Suit = Spades | Hearts | Diamonds | Clubs
            deriving (Eq,Show, Enum)

data Colour = Black | Red deriving Show

-- | Each suit has a colour – red or black
colour :: Suit -> Colour
colour Spades   = Black
colour Clubs    = Black
colour _        = Red


--  Cards have ranks: 2, 3 .. 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace
data Rank = Numeric Int | Jack | Queen | King | Ace
            deriving (Show,Eq,Ord)
            
--all_ranks

-- | When does one rank beat another rank?
rankBeats :: Rank -> Rank -> Bool
rankBeats r1 r2 = r1 > r2


-- | Alternatives to the  Rank type?

--data Rank' = N2 | N3 ... | King | Ace
--all_ranks'

--type Card = (Rank,Suit)

-- | A card has a rank and a suit
--data Card = Card Rank Suit deriving Show


-- | With field names

-- | A card beats another card when it has the same suit and it beats the rank
-- of the other card
